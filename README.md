## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

In this project, I learned to use below code snippet:

```css
#grid{
      display: grid;
      grid-template-areas: 'top top''left right';
}
#section-1{
      grid-area: top;
}
```

### Continued development

I'm looking to improve my CSS knowledge to design more unique and new stuff.
